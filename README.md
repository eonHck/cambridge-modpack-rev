* If you're running the game on Mac, extract them into `/Users/user/Library/Application Support/LOVE/cambridge/`.
* If you're running the game on Linux, extract them into `~/.local/share/love/cambridge/`.
* If you're running the game from the source code, extract them into the folder you installed Cambridge to.
